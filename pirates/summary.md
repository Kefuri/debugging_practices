### The Process ###

This file was more related to syntax and variable names. The first error was the missing " at the end of the puts statement, which means anything until the next " is considered a string instead of literal. The next was a syntax error - ```put``` instead of ```puts```.

Following this was a NameError, for an undefined local vairable ```Answer```. This was changed to greeting which is the name of the variable getting user input.

Finally, the ```if elsif``` statement had not been properly written, missing an `end` statement.
